ai-NES - Modernized JavaScript NES Emulator

A modernized Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator written in JavaScript. This project focuses on **accuracy, maintainability, and clean architecture**, with particular emphasis on correct mapper behavior and long-term extensibility.

## Features

* ✅ **Pure JavaScript** — Runs in any modern browser, no plugins required
* ✅ **ES6 Modules** — Clean, maintainable codebase with proper imports/exports
* ✅ **Modern Audio** — AudioWorklet-based sound with ScriptProcessor fallback
* ✅ **Expansion Audio Mixing** — MMC5 pulse + PCM audio mixed into APU output
* ✅ **Capability‑Driven Mappers** — The PPU interacts with mappers strictly through declared behavioral capabilities (no mapper IDs, no method‑presence heuristics)
* ✅ **Accurate Mapper Emulation** — Correct MMC1, MMC2, MMC3, MMC4, MMC5, and Sunsoft FME-7 (Mapper 069) behavior
* ✅ **CHR Latch Accuracy** — Hardware‑accurate MMC2/MMC4 latch triggering using real pattern fetch addresses (fine‑Y + both bitplanes)
* ✅ **Stable IRQ Timing** — MMC3 IRQs driven by true A12 rising‑edge detection
* ✅ **Drag & Drop ROM Loading** — Load `.nes` files directly into the emulator
* ✅ **Gamepad Support** — Native browser Gamepad API integration
* ✅ **Debug Snapshots** — F9 dumps mapper/PPU state including MMC5 audio registers

## Design Philosophy

This emulator intentionally avoids hard‑coding mapper IDs inside the PPU or CPU. Instead:

* Each mapper is modular - in its own file as if it were a hardware component, which then **declares behavioral capabilities** (e.g., CHR latch, A12 IRQ, nametable override, etc.)
* The PPU calls mapper hooks **only when the corresponding capability flag is set**
* If a capability is declared, the mapper guarantees the required method exists

This approach prevents cross‑mapper regressions and makes new mappers significantly easier to add while expanding the library of games that can run.

For deep technical details, see **TECHNICAL.md**.

## Development Notes

### Audio System

The emulator uses a two-tier audio system:

1. **AudioWorklet** (preferred) — Runs on a dedicated audio thread for glitch-free playback
2. **ScriptProcessor** (fallback) — For browsers without AudioWorklet support

Audio samples are batched and sent to the worklet to minimize postMessage overhead.
Expansion audio sources (such as MMC5) are mixed into the APU output path.

### Debugging

- **F9 snapshot** dumps PPU + mapper state to the console (MMC5 includes audio registers)
- **F4/F5/F10** toggle bus/MMC5/VRAM logging when supported

## Credits

This emulator is inspired by other JavaScript NES emulators, but coded to behave like console reference emulators. The CPU, PPU and APU are built from the ground up to behave like NES hardware.

And a special thanks to **[AccuracyCoin](https://github.com/100thCoin/AccuracyCoin/tree/main)**, which assisted greatly with game compatibility through accuracy testing and accuracy implementation.

## Compatibility Notes

If you want to make any improvements, please take a look at the **TECHNICAL.md** document and give it a whirl! Currently, there is no native or intentional support for homebrew. This release focuses on commercial releases.

There are about 15 games with compatibility issues that I know of:
